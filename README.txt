# weatherboi
A neural net trained to predict if it will rain in the second half of the day based on weather information from the first half.

For the input weather data file (i_data.csv):
> Each row should be one value
> They should be in the order of:
  -temperature (*F)
  -dew point (*F)
  -wind speed (mph)
  -Humidity (%)
  -Pressure (in)
> Ensure you are inputing in the right units
>wunderground.com is where I got the training data from so you can find todays values there for use
